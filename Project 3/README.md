Introduction:

In this assignment, you'll write a simple web application that will introduce you to HTML, form submission and server-side JavaScript.  You can use any code presented in the course modules for implementing this web app.

Learning Outcomes:

What tools and libraries we can use to develop web applications using Node? (Module 3 MLO 1)

What is HTML and what are the fundamental concepts of HTML? (Module 3 MLO 2)

What are some of the important HTML elements and their uses? (Module 3 MLO 3)

How can we create links from an HTML document to other HTML documents and write a web application that can serve such HTML documents? (Module 3 MLO 4)

What are HTML forms and how can we process them using Node? (Module 3 MLO 5)

Instructions:

Write a web application using Node and Express to
1. Serve the following 3 HTML pages

Homepage

Stock Order Page

Stock Search Page

2. Implement route handlers that

Service HTTP requests sent from the browser when users submit an HTML form from the Stock Order Page or the Stock Search Page, and

Send back appropriate HTTP responses to these requests

Note that in this assignment, you will not write any client-side JavaScript code, i.e., no JavaScript code will be executed in the browser. All the JavaScript code you write will execute server-side in the Express server.

The use of CSS isn't required for this assignment. However, you can use CSS for styling if you want. For example, you can use the CSS file style.cssLinks to an external site. we used in a replitLinks to an external site. in Exploration — HTML Tags to create borders around an HTML table.

Starter Code

We have provided you with a zip fileDownload a zip file that you must use as starter code.

Unzip the zip file, go to the directory where the files have been unzipped, then run the commands npm install once (to install the necessary packages) and then npm start to start the web app corresponding to the starter code.

Don't change the names of the files we have provided to you.

You can modify some of these files, with some exceptions, as noted below.

The file stocks.js contains data for this application.

Do not change anything in this file.

The file server.js contains the code for the server-side of your web app.

Add code for your route handlers and helper functions in this file.

However, there is some "boiler-plate" code in this file that you must not change. Comments in the file tell you which parts of the file you are not allowed to change.

The file index.html in the directory public is the homepage.

You need to modify this file to add the HTML elements required in the homepage.

The file package.json must not be changed without approval from the instructional staff.

This file includes the dependencies express and nodemon.

The start property is set to start the app using the file server.js.

Because you have been provided this file, you don't need to run the command npm init to initialize the app.

You can simply run the command npm install (once) to install the dependencies and then run npm start whenever you want to start the app.

Note that the app is run using nodemon. This means that when you make any changes to the file server.js and save that file, the app will automatically restart and pick up any code changes you made in server.js.

If you want to make any changes to package.json, e.g., to add other dependencies in this file, you must get the approval of the instructional staff. Don't make any changes in this file without our approval.

You can add more files to this web app.

In fact, you are required to add two more HTML files, one for the Stock Order Page and one for the Stock Search Page. You can name these 2 HTML files however you want.

You are also allowed to (but not required to) add files for CSS stylesheet(s) to the web app.

1. Homepage

Update index.html so that this page has an h1 element and includes links using the anchor element to the following 2 HTML pages that you will create

Stock Order Page

Stock Search Page

In addition to the h1 element and the 2 anchor elements, you can optionally add welcome text on this page to describe the web app.

2. Stock Order Page

Create an HTML file that displays the following information

An HTML table with the data provided in the file stocks.js, and

An HTML form to order stocks

This page must also have an h1 element in addition to the HTML table and the HTML form.

HTML Table:

The table must have one row of data for each stock in the file stocks.js

Each row in the HTML table must have the following 3 columns

Company name

Stock symbol

Current price

The table must have a header row.

The table must correctly use the thead and tbody tags.

Form to order stocks:

Underneath the HTML table, you must provide controls for the user to submit a stock order. The following controls must be provided:

A select element with a drop-down containing all the stock symbols from stocks.js

An input element of type number for entering the quantity to buy

A button to submit the form.

When the form is submitted, an HTTP request must be sent to the server running at localhost:3000

The request must include the user's selection for the stock symbol and the quantity they want to buy.

The server will send back the Stock Order Response which is displayed in the browser.

You are free to choose the URL for the form action, or to be more precise, you are free to choose the "path to resource" part of the URL.

See Exploration — URL for the parts of a URL should you need to review the topic.

You can choose either GET or POST as the method for the form.

Note: This page must be a static HTML file. No JavaScript code should be executed to generate or modify the page when a request comes for this page.

In the page type the HTML code for the HTML table using the data from the file stocks.js.

Similarly type in the HTML code for the select drop-down using the data from the file stocks.js.

Don't dynamically generate this page via a route handler in stocks.js for each request.

Stock Order Response

Add a route handler in server.js which gets executed when the server receives the request sent by the browser when the form on Stock Order Page is submitted.

This route handler must dynamically generate and send back the appropriate HTTP response.

Your JavaScript code must use the variable stocks  to access the stock data and you must not hard-code the data from the file stocks.js in your JavaScript code.

You must write a function findStockBySymbol(...).

This function must take one argument, a string value with the symbol of the stock to look up.

This function must return the stock object from the variable stocks that matches the symbol passed as the argument to the function.

This function doesn't need to handle the case where it is called with a symbol that doesn't exist in the variable stocks

Your route handler must call this function findStockBySymbol(...) passing it the symbol sent in the HTTP request and then use the object returned by the function to generate the response.

The response must be a string value with the following format:

You placed an order to buy N stocks of CompanyName. The price of one stock is $Y and the total price for this order is $Z

For example:

You placed an order to buy 10 stocks of Splunk. The price of one stock is $137.55 and the total price for this order is $1375.5

Optional

You can use string interpolation to create this string.

You can use toLocaleString() to format the price values using the currency formatLinks to an external site. specific to the US.

Sending the response

To send the response, your route handler must call res.send() with one argument which is the string with the required format described above.

You don't need to call any other methods on the response object. 

Note that when you call res.send()

If the argument to res.send() is a string value, by default Express automatically sets the Content-Type header in the response to text/html. So you don't need to explicitly set this header.

Again, by default Express sets the response status code to 200. So you don't need to explicitly set the status code of the response.

3. Stock Search Page

Create an HTML file with a form that provides two choices to the user for searching the stock data

Highest price

Lowest price

You must use radio buttons to provide these 2 choices to the user, and provide a button to submit the form.

This page must also have an h1 element in addition to the HTML form.

You are free to choose the URL for the action of the form, or to be more precise, you are free to choose the "path to resource" part of the URL.

You can choose either GET or POST as the method for the form.

When the form is submitted, an HTTP request must be sent to the server running at localhost:3000

The request must include the user's choice of the search criterion.

The server will send back the Stock Search Response which is displayed in the browser.

Note: This page must be a static HTML file. No JavaScript code should be executed to generate or modify the page when a request comes for this page.

Stock Search Response

Add a route handler in server.js which gets executed when the server receives the request sent by the browser when the form on Stock Search Page is submitted

This route handler must dynamically generate and send back the appropriate HTTP response.

Your JavaScript code must use the variable stocks  to access the stock data and you must not hard-code the data from the file stocks.js in your JavaScript code.

You must write a function findStockByPrice(...).

This function must take one argument which tells the function whether to find the stock with the lowest price or the one with the highest price

It must return the object from the variable stocks that matches the criterion passed as the argument.

In case of a tie, the function can return any one of the objects that meet the specified criterion.

This function must find the relevant stock "on the fly," i.e., you must not hard-code or permanently store the information about which stock has the highest price and which stock has the lowest price.

Your route handler must call this function findStockByPrice(...) passing it the criterion sent in the HTTP request and then use the object returned by the function to generate the response.

Your route handler can call the function with the exact value sent in the HTTP request. But this is not required.

This means that you can choose to map the value received in the request to some other value describing the user choice and call the function with that value.

Sending the response

To send the response, your route handler must call res.send() with one argument which is the object returned by the function findStockByPrice(...)

You don't need to call any other methods on the response object. 

Note that when you call res.send()

If the argument to res.send() is an object, by default Express automatically sets the Content-Type header in the response to application/json. So you don't need to explicitly set this header.

Again, by default Express sets the response status code to 200. So you don't need to explicitly set the status code of the response.
